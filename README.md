Group project in my senior year at Digital arts and Entertainment

A turn-based artillery and strategy game in a 2D environment with a space setting. 
The core concept is the practical implementation of artificial gravity put forward by NASA, the Stanford torus. 
This is represented by a  rotating donut or sphere where centrifugal forces emulate earth-gravity on the ground, 
but a different kind of gravity elsewhere, exemplifying the physics of apparent forces.

You play against 3 other players. The goal of each game is to be the last surviving player.
